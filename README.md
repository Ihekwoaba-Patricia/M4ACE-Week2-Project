#### How to use Git to track your file

```GIT
Install git in your system

use 'git init' to initialize

use 'git add .' to stage all your file

use git commit -m""  to save your file

then create an empty repo in your Github account

use 'git remote add origin (copy your SSH key here)' to push to another external machine like github.com

use 'git pull original main' to have your code to another branch

use 'git push origin main' to push to your github account

```
